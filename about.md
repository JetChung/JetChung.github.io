Hi! I'm Jet Chung, a rising first-year math(s) student at the University of Oxford. I am interested in all sorts of math, especially number theory and analysis. When I have time, my goal is to write explanations of various things and put them on this blog. Sadly, that will have to wait :)

### Education
* University of Oxford (Hertford College) 
* 2021 â€“ 2024 Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Mathematics
