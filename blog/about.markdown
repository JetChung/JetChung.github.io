Hi! I'm Jet Chung, a senior at Wayland High School. I will be studying mathematics at the University of Oxford, starting in fall 2021. I am interested in all sorts of math, especially number theory and analysis. This blog is mostly for my own organization of thoughts on various math related topics and snippets of the math Iâ€™m working on.

### Course Notes
