## AMC 12A
Hm so I got a 121.5, which is a 1.5 improvement from last year (incidentially, that's also the last time I did a practice AMC problem). So 11 has a chance of qualifying, but I'll probably need a 12 to be safe.

[Here's](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BurX23S1sIgGUyY9iEgJhXqB4LqmzE66/view) a solution manual to the entire test, compiled by Luke Choi, Preston Fu, Niyanth Rao, Eric Shen (California), Tovi Wen, and myself.
